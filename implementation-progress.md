# Implementation Progress Report

## Overview

This document summarizes the progress made on implementing the improvements outlined in the architectural assessment and implementation plan for the Smartsheet Azure AI integration.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Enhanced Session Management ✅

- Added session state tracking with INITIALIZING, ACTIVE, ERROR, and CLOSED states
- Implemented validation for sheet data presence
- Created a session recovery mechanism for sessions with missing data
- Added an endpoint for explicit sheet data loading
- Updated client-side components to use the enhanced session validation

### Phase 2: Tool Execution Improvements ✅

- Created a standardized tool result interface with clear success/error patterns
- Implemented error code categorization for more meaningful error messages
- Added retry logic for transient failures using the existing retry utility
- Enhanced the ToolExecutor class with improved error handling
- Updated the messages route to use the enhanced ToolExecutor
- Improved tool result communication to the LLM with structured responses

### Phase 3: WebSocket Management Consolidation ✅

- Created a centralized server-side event system (`server/services/events.ts`)
- Implemented a new WebSocket service that integrates with the event system (`server/services/websocket-service.ts`)
- Updated the webhooks implementation to use the centralized event system
- Enhanced the server's main file to use the new WebSocket service and event system
- Created an enhanced cache service with event system integration

### Phase 4: Azure OpenAI API Configuration ✅

- Implemented LiteLLM as a proxy for Azure OpenAI to support private endpoints
- Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/litellm-setup.md` and `docs/azure-openai-integration.md`
- Developed test scripts for connectivity verification (`scripts/test-litellm-connectivity.js`)
- Added npm scripts for starting LiteLLM and testing connectivity
- Configured proper error handling for API connectivity issues

### Phase 5: React Hooks Issues ✅

- Fixed inconsistent hook usage in components
- Created a hook checking and fixing tool (`scripts/fix-react-hooks.js`)
- Added documentation for React hooks best practices (`docs/react-hooks-fixes.md`)
- Added npm scripts for checking and fixing hooks issues
- Standardized on using the React namespace for hooks

## Remaining Work

### Phase 6: LLM Context and System Prompt

- Enhance system prompt with detailed sheet context
- Ensure sheet data is loaded immediately after session creation
- Implement context pruning for long conversations
- Add proactive sheet data loading

### Phase 7: Authentication Infrastructure

- Create authentication service layer
- Update database schema to include users table
- Create authentication middleware
- Implement frontend authentication context

### Phase 8: Cache Coordination Improvements

- Complete the implementation of the enhanced sheet data service
- Update all services to use the enhanced cache
- Implement cache versioning for consistency
- Add event-driven cache invalidation across all components

### Phase 9: Job Lifecycle Management

- Enhance job creation and tracking
- Implement job status monitoring
- Add job result caching
- Improve error handling for long-running jobs

## Implementation Details

### Centralized Event System

We've implemented a robust server-side event system that allows for:

- Event publishing and subscription
- Event history tracking
- Wildcard event listeners
- Structured event payloads with metadata

### Enhanced WebSocket Management

The new WebSocket service provides:

- Centralized client tracking
- Sheet subscription management
- Heartbeat monitoring for stale connections
- Integration with the event system for broadcasting updates

### Standardized Error Handling

The tool execution improvements include:

- Standardized error codes
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Consistent error formatting for LLM communication
- Validation of tool arguments

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of the enhanced sheet data service
2. Update all services to use the enhanced cache
3. Implement job lifecycle management improvements
4. Conduct thorough testing of the new components
5. Update documentation to reflect the architectural changes

## Conclusion

The implementation has made significant progress in addressing the issues identified in the architectural assessment. The centralized event system and improved session management provide a solid foundation for the remaining work. The next phases will focus on cache coordination and job lifecycle management to complete the implementation plan.
