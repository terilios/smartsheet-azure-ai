# LiteLLM Integration Solution

## Overview

This document summarizes the solution for integrating LiteLLM with Azure OpenAI in the ChatSheetAI application. The integration was initially experiencing authentication issues, but these have now been resolved.

## Solution

The key to resolving the authentication issues with LiteLLM and Azure OpenAI was making the following changes to the `litellm.config.yaml` file:

```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
    litellm_params:
      model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
      api_base: https://ai-idha-sbx-scus-001.openai.azure.com/
      api_version: "2024-08-01-preview"
      api_key: ${AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY}
      deployment_id: gpt-4o-2024-08-06

litellm_settings:
  drop_params: True
  set_verbose: True
  mode: azure

environment_variables:
  AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY: ${AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY}
```

### Key Changes

1. **Model Name Alignment**: Changed `model_name` from `gpt-4` to `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` to match the deployment name in Azure OpenAI.

2. **Model Parameter**: Changed `model` from `azure/gpt-4o` to `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` to match the deployment name.

3. **Azure Mode**: Added `mode: azure` to the `litellm_settings` section, which is critical for proper authentication with Azure OpenAI.

## Why It Works

The `mode: azure` setting in the LiteLLM configuration is crucial for Azure OpenAI integration. This setting tells LiteLLM to use the Azure OpenAI authentication method, which differs from the standard OpenAI authentication.

When using Azure OpenAI, the authentication requires:

- The correct API base URL
- The correct API key
- The correct API version
- The correct deployment ID
- The mode set to "azure"

Without the `mode: azure` setting, LiteLLM attempts to authenticate using the standard OpenAI method, which results in the "invalid audience" error we were seeing.

## Implications for the Application

Now that the LiteLLM integration is working, we can:

1. **Remove the Fallback Mechanism**: The fallback to direct Azure OpenAI is no longer necessary, though it may be prudent to keep it in place for robustness.

2. **Standardize on LiteLLM**: We can standardize on using LiteLLM for all Azure OpenAI interactions, which provides benefits like:

   - Support for private endpoints
   - Enhanced error handling and retry logic
   - Monitoring and logging capabilities
   - Abstraction for potential future LLM provider changes

3. **Update Documentation**: The model selection strategy and integration documentation should be updated to reflect the correct configuration.

## Model Selection Strategy

With the working LiteLLM integration, the model selection strategy should be updated to ensure consistency between:

1. **Environment Variables**:

   ```
   AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o-2024-08-06
   AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
   LITELLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-2024-08-06
   ```

2. **LiteLLM Configuration**:

   ```yaml
   model_name: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
   model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
   deployment_id: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
   ```

3. **Application Code**:
   ```typescript
   const config = {
     apiBase: process.env.LITELLM_API_BASE || "http://localhost:4000",
     model: process.env.LITELLM_MODEL || "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
   };
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Update Application Code**: Ensure the application code is using the correct model name when making requests to LiteLLM.

2. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the integration to ensure it continues to work reliably.

3. **Documentation**: Update all documentation to reflect the correct configuration.

4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring to track the performance and reliability of the LiteLLM integration.

5. **Focus on Remaining Tasks**: With the LiteLLM integration resolved, focus on completing the other critical tasks in the implementation plan:
   - Fixing the LLM context and system prompt
   - Implementing authentication infrastructure
   - Completing cache coordination
   - Completing job lifecycle management

## Conclusion

The LiteLLM integration with Azure OpenAI is now working correctly. The key to resolving the authentication issues was setting the `mode: azure` in the LiteLLM configuration. This allows the application to leverage the benefits of LiteLLM while maintaining compatibility with Azure OpenAI's authentication requirements.

This solution aligns with the project's requirements for private endpoint support and provides a robust foundation for the AI capabilities of the ChatSheetAI application.
