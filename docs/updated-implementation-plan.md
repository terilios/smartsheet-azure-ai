## Implementation Approach

### 1. Fix LLM Context and System Prompt

The system prompt is a critical component of the AI assistant's capabilities. It provides the context and instructions that guide the AI's responses. The current implementation needs to be enhanced to include more detailed sheet context.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Analyze Current Implementation**:

   - Review the current system prompt in `server/routes/messages.ts`
   - Identify opportunities for enhancement

2. **Enhance System Prompt**:

   - Add detailed sheet context, including column names, data types, and sample data
   - Include instructions for handling different types of queries
   - Add examples of good responses

3. **Load Sheet Data on Session Creation**:

   - Modify `server/routes/sessions.ts` to load sheet data when creating a new session
   - Store the sheet data in the session state
   - Ensure the sheet data is available for the system prompt

4. **Implement Context Pruning**:
   - Develop a strategy for pruning the conversation context when it gets too long
   - Ensure important context is preserved
   - Test with long conversations to verify effectiveness

### 2. Implement Authentication Infrastructure

Authentication is essential for securing the application and providing personalized experiences. The implementation should support both user authentication and API key authentication for integrations.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Create Authentication Service**:

   - Implement user registration and login
   - Support multiple authentication methods (email/password, OAuth)
   - Implement token generation and validation

2. **Update Database Schema**:

   - Create users table with necessary fields
   - Add relationships to sessions and other entities
   - Implement migrations

3. **Create Authentication Middleware**:

   - Implement middleware for authenticating API requests
   - Support both user tokens and API keys
   - Handle authentication errors gracefully

4. **Implement Frontend Authentication**:
   - Create authentication context for managing user state
   - Implement login and registration forms
   - Add protected routes

### 3. Complete Cache Coordination

Efficient cache coordination is crucial for performance and data consistency. The enhanced sheet data service should provide a robust caching mechanism that ensures data is always up-to-date.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Finish Enhanced Sheet Data Service**:

   - Complete the implementation in `server/services/enhanced-sheet-data.ts`
   - Ensure it handles all necessary sheet operations

2. **Update Services to Use Enhanced Cache**:

   - Modify existing services to use the enhanced cache
   - Ensure consistent data access patterns

3. **Implement Event-Driven Cache Invalidation**:
   - Create events for data changes
   - Implement listeners for cache invalidation
   - Test cache consistency with concurrent operations

### 4. Complete Job Lifecycle Management

Long-running jobs need proper lifecycle management to ensure reliability and resource efficiency. This includes job creation, tracking, progress updates, and cleanup.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Enhance Job Creation and Tracking**:

   - Improve job creation API
   - Implement robust job tracking
   - Add support for job dependencies

2. **Improve Progress Updates**:

   - Implement real-time progress updates
   - Create a consistent progress reporting format
   - Add support for detailed status messages

3. **Implement Job Cleanup and Resource Management**:
   - Add automatic cleanup for completed jobs
   - Implement resource limits and quotas
   - Add monitoring for job resource usage

## Timeline and Milestones

1. **Week 1**: Fix LLM Context and System Prompt
2. **Week 2-3**: Implement Authentication Infrastructure
3. **Week 4**: Complete Cache Coordination
4. **Week 5**: Complete Job Lifecycle Management
5. **Week 6**: Testing, Bug Fixes, and Documentation

## Conclusion

With the Azure OpenAI API configuration and React hooks issues resolved, we can now focus on the remaining tasks. The updated implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the project, with a focus on enhancing the AI assistant's capabilities, implementing authentication, and ensuring robust cache coordination and job lifecycle management.

The successful resolution of the LiteLLM integration issues demonstrates the team's ability to overcome technical challenges and sets a positive precedent for tackling the remaining tasks.
