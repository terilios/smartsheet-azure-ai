The code exhibits two primary cross-domain challenges:

1. **Same-Origin Policy Restrictions**  
   - **Issue:**  
     The functions `handleBack()` and `handleForward()` attempt to manipulate the iframe’s history by accessing `iframeRef.current.contentWindow.history`. When the iframe loads a page from a different domain (i.e., a cross-origin URL), the browser’s same-origin policy prevents any JavaScript on your page from accessing properties (like the history or DOM) of that iframe. This restriction is inherent to web security and is enforced to prevent malicious interactions between unrelated sites.  
   - **How It Manifests in the Code:**  
     The code wraps the navigation calls in try-catch blocks. When a cross-origin page is loaded, attempting to access `contentWindow.history` throws an exception, and the error state is updated with a message like “Navigation not available due to security restrictions.”

2. **Embedding Restrictions (X-Frame-Options / CSP)**  
   - **Issue:**  
     Some websites explicitly prevent their content from being embedded in iframes on external domains. This is typically enforced via HTTP headers such as `X-Frame-Options` (which might be set to `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`) or via the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) directive `frame-ancestors`. If the target website sets these headers, the browser will block the rendering of the page in the iframe regardless of any client-side code changes.
   - **How It Manifests in the Code:**  
     The error message “Unable to load page. Some pages may not allow embedding.” in the `handleIframeError()` function hints at this problem. Even if the URL is corrected and loaded, the browser may refuse to display the page due to these headers.

### Making the Code “Open” to Any Domain

Because of these browser-enforced restrictions, there is no client-side “hack” to bypass cross-domain security policies. However, there are several approaches you can consider, depending on your requirements:

1. **Use a Proxy Server (Reverse Proxy Approach):**  
   - **Concept:**  
     Instead of directly embedding the remote URL, you can create a server-side proxy that fetches the remote content and serves it from your own domain. This effectively “repackages” the content to appear as if it’s coming from the same origin, which sidesteps the same-origin policy for JavaScript interactions.
   - **Considerations:**  
     - **Pros:**  
       - Allows you to manipulate or interact with the content as needed since it’s served from your domain.  
     - **Cons:**  
       - **Legal and Ethical:** Many websites disallow this in their terms of service.  
       - **Technical:** Modern websites rely on dynamic content, session handling, and absolute URLs, which can break if proxied improperly.  
       - **Security:** You need to secure your proxy to avoid abuse (e.g., being used for open proxy attacks).
   - **Example:**  
     You might use a server-side language (like Node.js with Express) to set up an endpoint `/proxy?url=...` that fetches the content and streams it back to the client. Your iframe would then load `/proxy?url=https://target-domain.com`.

2. **Rely on `window.open` Instead of an Iframe:**  
   - **Concept:**  
     Since the restrictions primarily affect iframe interactions (and not simply viewing a site), you can bypass these issues by opening the target URL in a new browser tab or window using the `openInNewTab()` function.
   - **Implementation:**  
     Modify your UI so that if navigation actions (back, forward, refresh) are not possible due to cross-origin restrictions, the user is prompted (or automatically redirected) to open the link in a new tab.
   - **Benefits:**  
     - Bypasses iframe restrictions entirely.  
     - Preserves user interaction with the target site without violating cross-origin policies.
   - **Example:**  
     The existing `openInNewTab` function is a good fallback, ensuring that the user can always view the target page even if it can’t be manipulated within an iframe.

3. **Cooperative Cross-Domain Communication:**  
   - **Concept:**  
     If you control both domains (or can collaborate with the external domain), you can use the [`Window.postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) API to securely communicate between the parent window and the iframe. This requires the embedded page to have a listener that accepts messages and, optionally, sends responses back.
   - **Considerations:**  
     - **Pros:**  
       - Enables interaction while still respecting security boundaries.  
     - **Cons:**  
       - Requires modification on the remote site, which is not feasible if you do not control it.
   - **Example:**  
     The parent page can send a message like `{ action: "goBack" }` to the iframe, and if the iframe has a corresponding event listener, it can process the action (e.g., navigate its own history).

### Summary of Recommendations

- **For Full Interaction (Navigation Controls):**  
  Use a proxy if you must interact with the iframe’s content. Be aware of the legal, technical, and security challenges.

- **For Simple Viewing:**  
  Rely on opening the URL in a new tab (using `window.open`) to avoid cross-domain restrictions entirely. This is the simplest and most robust approach when you do not need to manipulate the iframe’s internal state.

- **For Cooperative Scenarios:**  
  Implement cross-document messaging using `postMessage` if both the parent and the embedded site can be modified for inter-window communication.

Each approach has trade-offs, and the best choice depends on your specific use case, security posture, and whether you have control over the embedded content.
