Thanks for the clarification! Since you need a general solution that works for third-party sites you don’t control, the best approach will likely involve a server-side proxy to bypass iframe restrictions while maintaining security and performance. I’ll research:

- How to set up a secure and efficient server-side proxy to serve external websites within an iframe.
- Techniques to handle X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy restrictions.
- Considerations for caching, security, and performance when proxying external content.
- Legal and ethical implications of proxying third-party content.

I’ll get back to you with the best solutions soon!

# Embedding Third-Party Websites in an Iframe via a Proxy

Embedding a third-party website in an iframe can be challenging when the target site sets **X-Frame-Options** or **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)** headers to prevent framing. These headers are intended to stop clickjacking and unauthorized embedding, and browsers will refuse to display such pages in an iframe. To work around this, a **server-side proxy** can fetch and serve the external content with modified headers, allowing it to appear in an iframe on your site. This approach must be implemented carefully to maintain security, performance, and legal compliance. Below, we outline how to build a general-purpose solution to embed any site via a proxy, covering proxy implementation, bypassing X-Frame-Options/CSP, handling dynamic content and authentication, caching and security measures, and legal/ethical considerations.

## Understanding the Restrictions (X-Frame-Options and CSP)

Many websites send headers that **forbid framing** by other sites. Two common mechanisms are:

- **X-Frame-Options**: An HTTP response header with values like `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` that instruct browsers to block the page from being loaded in any iframe or only allow it from the same origin ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=,is%20allowed%2C%20external%20web%20pages)). For example, `X-Frame-Options: DENY` means “do not allow this page in a frame at all,” and `SAMEORIGIN` means “only allow in a frame if the parent is from the same site.”
- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: A security header that can include a `frame-ancestors` directive, which serves a similar purpose. For instance, `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'` also means no other site can frame this content ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=,is%20allowed%2C%20external%20web%20pages)). CSP is more modern and can specify allowed parent domains (e.g., `frame-ancestors example.com`).

These measures are in place *for good reason*: to prevent **clickjacking** attacks and unauthorized use of content. Normally, if you try to directly iframe a page that sets these headers, users will see an error like “Refused to display document because of X-Frame-Options” or “Content refused to connect.” ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=This%20PHP%20script%20is%20a,iframe%2C%20effectively%20circumventing%20these%20restrictions)). 

**Key Point:** To embed such a page, you cannot simply use a normal `<iframe src="...">` pointing to the original URL. The browser will honor the target site's headers and block it. The **only general solution** (without target-site cooperation) is to **act as a middleman**: have your server fetch the page and present it as if it’s your content. This way, your server can strip or alter the offending headers before the response reaches the user's browser ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=This%20PHP%20script%20is%20a,iframe%2C%20effectively%20circumventing%20these%20restrictions)).

## Implementing a Server-Side Proxy for Iframing

A server-side proxy will act as a relay between the user’s browser and the third-party site. Instead of the iframe loading the external site directly, it will load a **proxy URL** on *your server*, which internally fetches the external page. The proxy then returns the content to the browser, but since it comes from your domain (or a controlled domain), you can remove or modify headers that would normally prevent framing. 

**How the Proxy Approach Works:** ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=1.%20Server,including%20any%20dynamically%20loaded%20resources))

1. **Server-side Fetch:** Your server accepts a target URL (e.g., via a query parameter or path) and performs an HTTP request (using a library like `cURL` in PHP, `requests` in Python, or `node-fetch`/HTTP module in Node.js) to retrieve the page’s HTML ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=1.%20Server,to%20the%20client%2C%20ensuring%20it)). It should follow redirects and get the full content just as a browser would. Ensure you handle TLS (HTTPS) properly and preserve cookies or session data if needed for login-protected pages (discussed later).
2. **Remove/Modify Blocking Headers:** Upon receiving the response, strip out or override any headers that would interfere with framing. This means removing `X-Frame-Options` and any `Content-Security-Policy` headers that include `frame-ancestors` or frame restrictions ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=3,including%20any%20dynamically%20loaded%20resources)). You may also need to adjust other CSP directives if they would block content when served from a new origin (for simplicity, many implementations remove the CSP header entirely to avoid conflicts ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=3,including%20any%20dynamically%20loaded%20resources))). For example, in Node.js using Express, you could use a middleware or proxy library and then delete or change those headers in the proxy response. In Nginx, you could use `proxy_hide_header X-Frame-Options;` and similar directives for CSP.
3. **Rewrite URLs in the Content:** A crucial step is to rewrite any **relative URLs** and **domain-specific references** in the HTML so that all resources load through the proxy. When the browser later requests images, scripts, or CSS referenced in the page, those should also go via your proxy; otherwise, the page might try to load some resources directly from the third-party domain (which could be blocked by CORS or not load due to CSP). The proxy should parse the HTML and convert:
   - Relative URLs (e.g. `<img src="/images/logo.png">`) into absolute URLs pointing to the proxy (e.g. `<img src="https://**yourproxy**/?url=https://target.com/images/logo.png">`).
   - Absolute URLs to the target domain (e.g. `src="https://target.com/script.js"`) into proxy links (e.g. `src="https://yourproxy.com/?url=https://target.com/script.js"`).  
   - URLs in HTML attributes like `href`, `src`, `action` (for forms), and even within scripts (e.g., an AJAX endpoint) should all be identified and rewritten ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=2,including%20any%20dynamically%20loaded%20resources)). This ensures **all linked and dynamically loaded resources are routed through the proxy** ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=%2A%20restrictive%20headers%20%28e.g.%2C%20X,are%20routed%20through%20the%20proxy)).  
   *Implementation:* You can use an HTML parser or regex cautiously to find URLs. For example, a PHP proxy script might use DOMDocument or simple regex replacements; a Node.js proxy might stream through an HTML rewriting transform. The key is to prepend or replace URLs so that they point to the proxy URL with the external URL as a parameter.
4. **Handle Script-Based Frame Busting:** Some pages include JavaScript "frame-buster" code that detects if they are in an iframe and then break out. Commonly, scripts check if `window.top !== window.self` and then redirect the top window. As a proxy implementer, you may choose to neutralize these. This can be done by removing or altering those script blocks during the rewrite step. For instance, you could strip out any `<script>` tags containing known frame-busting patterns. This is not foolproof (as sites can use various methods), but basic patterns like `if (window.top !== window.self)` can be searched and removed or disabled. **Caution:** Removing JavaScript can sometimes break functionality, so this should be done judiciously.
5. **Return the Modified Content:** Finally, send the rewritten HTML to the browser. Because the response now comes from your server (which presumably does not set X-Frame-Options and has a relaxed CSP), the browser will allow it to render inside the iframe. All sub-resources will also be fetched via your proxy (due to rewritten URLs), which gives you an opportunity to continue stripping headers on those responses as needed. The end result is the user sees the external site inside an iframe on your page, and it functions as if it were being loaded directly, *but* all network requests funnel through your proxy.

### Example Proxy Implementation

Below is a **simplified example** of a proxy script (in PHP) that demonstrates these steps. It uses PHP's cURL to fetch a page and then adjusts the content and headers. (In a production setting, you’d need more robust HTML parsing and error handling, but this illustrates the core idea):

```php
<?php
// Simple PHP iframe proxy example
$targetUrl = filter_input(INPUT_GET, 'url', FILTER_VALIDATE_URL);
if (!$targetUrl) {
    http_response_code(400);
    echo "Invalid URL";
    exit;
}

// Fetch the target URL content
$ch = curl_init($targetUrl);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true);
$response = curl_exec($ch);

// Get response headers (if needed to handle cookies or content-type)
$info = curl_getinfo($ch);
curl_close($ch);

// Basic security header removal (the proxy will not forward these to client)
header_remove("X-Frame-Options");
header_remove("Content-Security-Policy");
// You may want to set a generic CSP that allows everything from the proxy domain, 
// or no CSP at all, to avoid restricting content.

$content = $response;

// Rewrite relative URLs to absolute URLs via this proxy
$base = parse_url($targetUrl);
$origin = $base["scheme"] . "://" . $base["host"];
// Replace src/href/action attributes
$content = preg_replace(
    '#(src|href|action)=(["\'])(/[^"\'>]+)#i', 
    '$1=$2' . $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] . '?url=' . $origin . '$3', 
    $content
);
// (Note: The above regex is a simple example and may not cover all cases or edge cases.)

// Remove simple framebusters (example: scripts trying to break out of iframes)
$content = preg_replace(
    '#<script\b[^>]*>.*?window\.top\s*!=\s*window\.self.*?</script>#is', 
    '', 
    $content
);

// Send the modified content to the browser
echo $content;
```

In this example, any request like `https://yourserver.com/proxy.php?url=https://example.com` will return the *example.com* page’s content but with anti-framing headers removed and links adjusted to route through `proxy.php`. You could then embed it with `<iframe src="https://yourserver.com/proxy.php?url=https://example.com" ...></iframe>`.

*Note:* Instead of a custom script, you could also use a server like **Nginx** as a reverse proxy. For instance, you might configure Nginx with `proxy_pass` to the target site and use `proxy_hide_header X-Frame-Options` and `proxy_hide_header Content-Security-Policy` to drop those headers. You’d still need some way to rewrite the HTML content for links (which can be done with nginx’s `sub_filter` directive, though that may be less flexible than a script).

## Bypassing X-Frame-Options and CSP Safely

The primary goal of the proxy is to **bypass X-Frame-Options/CSP restrictions** by removing or altering those headers. Here are strategies and considerations for doing this safely:

- **Strip or Override the Headers:** As described, the simplest approach is to not forward the `X-Frame-Options` and `Content-Security-Policy` headers from the target site. When your proxy returns content to the client, omit these headers or replace them with more permissive ones. For example, you could set `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` on your response (or no header at all), and you could remove `frame-ancestors` from CSP or clear the CSP entirely ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=3,including%20any%20dynamically%20loaded%20resources)). This effectively tells the browser there is no restriction on framing for the content served via the proxy. *Be sure* to do this for **every resource** (HTML pages as well as any sub-resources that might inadvertently carry such headers).
- **Adjust CSP if Necessary:** Some sites use CSP not just to control framing but to whitelist script sources, styles, etc. If you remove the CSP header entirely, the proxied page will run without those security constraints. This could be fine, but be aware that you are now running the page in a potentially less secure context. An alternative approach is to programmatically edit the CSP header. For example, you could parse the CSP and remove only the `frame-ancestors` directive (leaving the rest intact). That way, the site’s other restrictions (scripts, images, etc.) remain in effect. However, note that the meaning of directives like `'self'` will change because the origin is now your proxy domain, not the original domain. In practice, completely removing CSP might be simpler to ensure the page loads, but it has security trade-offs.
- **Use a CORS/CSP Bypass Web Component (Alternative):** A client-side alternative (for modern browsers) is the **X-Frame-Bypass** web component ([html - Bypass X-Frame-Options - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41718033/bypass-x-frame-options#:~:text=1)). This is a custom `<iframe is="x-frame-bypass" src="...">` element that internally fetches the content via a CORS proxy and displays it. It’s essentially doing a similar thing (loading the page via JavaScript and injecting it) without needing a full custom server setup. This can work for specific cases and is worth mentioning, but generally a dedicated server-side proxy gives more control over security and performance (and can handle non-CORS-friendly sites by acting as a true proxy).
- **“Safe” Bypassing and Legal Considerations:** The word **“safely”** here means not introducing vulnerabilities for your users. When you strip security headers, you should ensure that you’re not exposing your own site to risk. For example, if the proxied page has malicious content or an XSS vulnerability, removing CSP could allow it to run more freely in the context of your domain. One mitigation is to serve the proxied content from a separate domain or subdomain that doesn’t share sensitive cookies or data with your main site. You could also apply the HTML5 `sandbox` attribute on the iframe (e.g., `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms">`), which imposes restrictions on what the framed content can do (this can disable features like top-navigation, popups, or even restrict scripts, depending on the flags). Sandbox can provide a safety net, but note that if you *fully* sandbox (no `allow-scripts`), the content might not function properly. So it’s a balance between functionality and security.

**Legality:** Simply put, removing these headers on content that is not yours *may violate the target site’s Terms of Service* ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=other%20sites%20from%20embedding%20their,is%20allowed%2C%20external%20web%20pages)). From a legal standpoint, you are circumventing a protection that the site put in place. In many cases this is not *illegal* per se (there’s no specific law against framing content, unless anti-circumvention laws are interpreted extremely), but it can be against the site’s usage terms. The general advice: do this only in ethical ways – for example, for personal or internal use, or when you have permission from the content owner. We discuss more legal/ethical points at the end.

## Handling Dynamic Content, Authentication, and Interactivity

Simply fetching and serving the HTML is not enough if the page has interactive elements or requires login. Here’s how to handle dynamic aspects in a proxied iframe:

- **Linked Resources (Scripts, Images, CSS):** As mentioned, all resource URLs in the HTML should be rewritten to go through the proxy. This allows images, stylesheets, and scripts to load successfully. When implementing, ensure the proxy can serve these binary assets efficiently (it might simply stream them without modification, aside from stripping headers). If the page uses many AJAX calls or fetch requests via JavaScript, those calls will typically target the original domain. Since the page is now loaded from your domain, any JS requests to the original domain would be cross-origin – and likely blocked by CORS or not reach the right place. To fix this, you should also rewrite XHR/fetch URLs. This can be tricky because such URLs might be constructed in script (not just static in HTML). One strategy is to intercept them at runtime by injecting a small script into the page that overrides `XMLHttpRequest.open` and `fetch` to prepend your proxy’s URL. For instance, an injected script can check if a request URL starts with the original site’s origin and if so, replace it with your proxy endpoint. This way, even dynamic calls get routed through the proxy. The proxy then performs those requests and returns data, just as it does for the main page ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=2,including%20any%20dynamically%20loaded%20resources)) ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=%2A%20restrictive%20headers%20%28e.g.%2C%20X,are%20routed%20through%20the%20proxy)).
- **Forms and User Actions:** If the embedded page contains forms (login forms, search boxes, etc.), the form actions should also be rewritten to go through the proxy ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=2,including%20any%20dynamically%20loaded%20resources)). In the example above, we adjust form `action` attributes. This means when a user submits a form, it actually posts to your proxy, which then should forward the request to the target site and relay the response back. Implementing this essentially turns your proxy into a mini HTTP client for the user’s actions. You’ll need to forward method (GET/POST), body, and headers (especially cookies or auth tokens).
- **Authentication and Session Handling:** For pages that require login, you have two main approaches:
  1. **User logs in through the proxied iframe:** The login page itself is proxied. The user enters credentials into the framed login form, and the proxy forwards them to the real site. The site responds with a session cookie as usual. However, that cookie is for the site’s own domain, which the browser would normally not store (since the response is coming from your proxy domain). You can work around this by **cookie management in the proxy**. The proxy can capture `Set-Cookie` headers from the target and store them server-side (perhaps in the user’s session on your server). For subsequent requests from that same user, the proxy adds the stored cookies in the outbound request to the target site. In effect, the proxy maintains an **authenticated session on behalf of the user**. This requires your proxy to differentiate sessions (so one user’s cookies don’t go to another). You might use a session cookie on the proxy itself to identify the user and map to their target-site cookies. This is complex but doable. The result is the user logs in (still within the iframe) and afterward the target site’s content continues to load via proxy with authenticated requests.
  2. **Server-side authentication** (if credentials are known beforehand or a single account): This is less common, but if, say, the content is behind a login that you control, the proxy server could itself log in to the target site and then serve content. This doesn’t scale for multiple users with different creds, but could be used for, say, embedding a single account’s dashboard for many viewers.
  
  Handling authentication is one of the trickiest parts of a general-purpose embed proxy. If the target site uses modern auth patterns (like OAuth popups, or multi-factor auth), it may be very hard to fully support in an embedded context. A simpler scenario is basic cookie-based session which a proxy can emulate as described.

- **Interactive Elements and Scripts:** Most interactive content (drop-downs, maps, videos, etc.) will work if their resources are loaded properly. But some things might not:
  - **WebSockets:** If the site uses WebSockets (e.g., for live updates), you’d need to proxy those as well. This means your server needs to accept a WebSocket connection from the browser and open a corresponding one to the target, shuttling data between them. Some proxy servers or libraries support this (for instance, Node’s `http-proxy` can proxy WS). If not handled, WebSocket connections will fail due to the origin mismatch or the site’s policy.
  - **Browser APIs:** Features like geolocation, camera, etc., typically won’t function inside an iframe unless allowed via permissions and `allow` attributes on the iframe. If the target site expects to use such APIs, you would have to add `allow="geolocation; camera; microphone"` attributes to your iframe and perhaps proxy any related requests if needed.
  - **Sandboxing Impact:** If you used the `sandbox` attribute on the iframe for security, note that it can disable or alter some interactive capabilities. For example, `sandbox` without `allow-scripts` would prevent any script from running on the embedded page, essentially breaking most dynamic content. So use the minimal necessary restrictions (e.g., `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms"` might be a reasonable balance: scripts run, forms can submit, but the content cannot initiate downloads or change the top-level navigation).
  
In summary, to handle dynamic and interactive content, the proxy must **masquerade as the browser** to the target site, and as the target site to the browser. This often means implementing a combination of HTML rewriting, JavaScript injection, and careful HTTP header management to keep the two sides in sync.

## Caching, Rate Limiting, and Security Measures

Running an open proxy for web content raises concerns about performance and abuse. Here are important considerations for caching and security:

- **Enable Caching of Content:** Caching can dramatically improve performance and reduce load on both your proxy and the target site. You can implement caching in a few ways:
  - In the proxy server code, store recent responses (for example, in memory or on disk, or using a caching reverse proxy like Varnish). If multiple users request the same URL through your proxy, you can serve it from cache rather than refetching from the source every time. Even for a single user, if they navigate back and forth, caching helps. 
  - Use HTTP caching headers: If the target site provides `Last-Modified` or `ETag` and cacheability headers, your proxy can forward those and respect them. Your proxy could send conditional requests (If-Modified-Since) to the target to check if cached content is still fresh.
  - Be cautious about what to cache. Public, static content (images, CSS, general pages) can be cached. **Avoid caching personal or sensitive content** that might appear when users are logged in – you wouldn’t want to accidentally serve one user’s private data to another. For safety, you might bypass caching for any URLs that appear to require a logged-in session (or implement per-user caches in such scenarios).
- **Implement Rate Limiting:** An iframe proxy could be abused by malicious users or bots to retrieve data from third-party sites (including potentially using your proxy as an anonymization service). To prevent overload and abuse:
  - Limit the number of requests per minute from a single IP or user to your proxy. For instance, you could allow a burst of requests for normal browsing, but if one client starts making dozens of requests per second, start dropping or throttling them.
  - Optionally require an API key or some form of authentication for using the proxy, if it’s a private service. This ensures you know who is using it and can cut off abusers.
  - Log the requests so you can monitor usage patterns. If a certain target site is being hammered, you might introduce specific limits or captchas.
  - Remember that if your proxy is public, *you become responsible for traffic to the target sites*. If someone uses your proxy to attack a site (e.g., brute force something or scrape aggressively), the target will see your server’s IP and could block or take action against you. So, set boundaries like denying obviously excessive use. For better security, consider adding **authentication or API keys** to restrict who can use the proxy ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=Security%20Considerations)).
- **Input Validation and Allowed Domains:** At minimum, validate that the input URL is a well-formed `http://` or `https://` URL ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=Security%20Considerations)). Disallow other schemas (no `file:///` or internal LAN addresses) to prevent server-side request forgery (SSRF) that could target your internal network. You might also maintain an allow-list or block-list of domains. For example, you might decide not to allow proxying of certain high-risk or disallowed sites. If this is for internal/company use, maybe restrict to a set of known domains. If it’s public, clearly document what is permitted.
- **Security of the Proxy Server:** Since the proxy will be fetching arbitrary HTML, you need to ensure that the parsing and rewriting process is secure. Use libraries or thoroughly tested code for HTML parsing to avoid injection vulnerabilities. The content fetched is untrusted, but typically it shouldn’t harm the server if just treated as data. The bigger risk is to the end-user’s browser, so consider the earlier point of sandboxing or isolating the content on a separate domain. Also, run the proxy with least privileges – it should not have access to sensitive server data.
- **HTTPS and Mixed Content:** Serve your proxy over HTTPS if the embedded content includes any sensitive data or if the parent site is HTTPS (to avoid mixed-content issues). The proxy should fetch the target over HTTPS as well if the original URL is https. Essentially, maintain the same level of security end-to-end so you’re not downgrading the connection. Modern browsers will block or warn about active mixed content (scripts loaded over HTTP in an HTTPS page), so your proxy might need to upgrade links (e.g., if a page has an `http://` script and you’re serving the main page via `https://`, consider rewriting that to `https://` if the target supports it).
- **Prevent Open Relay Abuse:** Ensure your proxy can’t be easily used to attack others. We covered rate limiting and domain restrictions, which help. Another aspect is to avoid open redirect behavior – if your proxy takes a URL param, make sure it doesn’t allow XSS or HTML injection via that param (use proper URL encoding when inserting it into HTML, etc.). Also, consider restricting or sanitizing response headers from the target; you generally forward only what’s needed (content type, maybe cookies via your mechanism, etc.). Drop any `Set-Cookie` from the target if not dealing with login, to avoid storing cookies for the proxy domain unnecessarily.

In practice, many of these concerns are similar to running any caching proxy or mirror. For example, **Cloudflare** and other CDN services do content caching and enforce rate limits to avoid overwhelming origin servers ([How does Rate Limiting work? - Security - Cloudflare Community](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/how-does-rate-limiting-work/60#:~:text=Community%20community,or%20for%20an%20entire%20zone)) ([Limiting Access to Proxied HTTP Resources | NGINX Documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/controlling-access-proxied-http/#:~:text=Limiting%20Access%20to%20Proxied%20HTTP,downloading%20content%20from%20the%20server)). You can take inspiration from such systems for strategies.

## Legal and Ethical Implications of Proxying Content

It’s important to understand the **legal and ethical context** of bypassing X-Frame-Options and CSP to embed a third-party site:

- **Terms of Service and Copyright:** Most websites have Terms of Service that often include clauses against rehosting or embedding content without permission. By using a proxy to serve their content, you might be violating those terms ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=other%20sites%20from%20embedding%20their,is%20allowed%2C%20external%20web%20pages)). For non-public or personal projects, this might not ever be noticed, but if you deploy a public service that lets anyone iframe any site, you could receive complaints or legal requests from content owners. Always review the target site’s policies. Some content (like videos, maps, etc.) offer official embed APIs or licenses – prefer those when available, rather than a raw proxy.
- **Ethical Use and Intent:** Consider *why* the site disallowed framing. Often it’s for user protection (clickjacking). If you circumvent it, in some cases you might expose users to the very attacks the header was protecting against. For example, if you frame a banking site’s login, that bank intentionally blocked framing to prevent a malicious site from doing exactly that and tricking the user. If *you* frame it, even with no bad intention, you’re creating a scenario that the bank deems insecure. Ethically, you shouldn’t allow potentially sensitive sites to be framed and interacted with unless you have a really good reason and user consent.  
- **Closed vs. Open Environments:** If your use-case is internal (e.g., embedding a dashboard from one internal tool into another for your company, and you control both sides), then bypassing the header isn’t likely to raise issues – it’s within a controlled environment. Similarly, if you’re doing it for personal convenience (like a hobby project to see multiple websites in one page), it’s unlikely anyone will object. But doing this on a public website that lets users browse arbitrary third-party sites inside your frame is much more sensitive.
- **Attribution and Modification:** Remember that when you proxy content, you are effectively republishing it. Make sure you are not removing attributions, and consider whether you need to visually indicate that the content is from an external site. Some sites might have branding or watermarks which is fine, but if not, the user might be confused about whose content it is. Being transparent can avoid misunderstandings.
- **Potential Liability:** In some jurisdictions, if your service is used to facilitate illegal actions (say, someone uses your proxy to access copyrighted material in a way that bypasses paywalls or geo-restrictions), you could face liability. Have terms for your own service, and perhaps a mechanism to block certain uses if notified by content owners.
- **Use of Robots.txt / Bot Detection:** A sophisticated site might treat your proxy as a bot or scraper. They could attempt to block it via IP bans or by requiring challenges (CAPTCHAs). Ethically, if a site is actively trying to block automated access and you continuously circumvent that, you might be veering into “unauthorized access” territory (which could potentially implicate laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the US, if taken to an extreme). It’s a gray area, but the safest route is: *get permission if possible*. If not, at least ensure your proxy respects the target’s server (don’t hammer it, identify yourself in the user-agent string, and comply with any cease-and-desist requests).

In summary, **use this power responsibly** ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=other%20sites%20from%20embedding%20their,is%20allowed%2C%20external%20web%20pages)). The technical solution of a proxy can make almost any site embeddable, but just because you *can* doesn’t always mean you *should*. Evaluate on a case-by-case basis, and when in doubt, seek permission or legal advice for your specific scenario.

## Conclusion

By leveraging a server-side proxy, it is possible to embed third-party websites in an iframe even if they normally send X-Frame-Options or CSP headers to prevent it. The general approach involves fetching the content on the server, rewriting it (to remove anti-framing headers and adjust resource links), and then serving it to the client’s iframe ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=This%20PHP%20script%20is%20a,iframe%2C%20effectively%20circumventing%20these%20restrictions)) ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=1.%20Server,including%20any%20dynamically%20loaded%20resources)). This approach can be implemented in various languages (PHP, Node.js, etc.) or with a reverse-proxy server, and we provided examples and code snippets illustrating the concept. 

When building such a system, pay special attention to dynamic content and user interaction to ensure the embedded site remains functional – this may involve proxying form submissions, AJAX calls, and even neutralizing frame-busting scripts. Equally important are the performance optimizations (like caching) and abuse protections (rate limiting, input validation) that keep your proxy running safely and efficiently ([Bypass X-Frame-Options: PHP Proxy for iframe Embedding · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cprima/5c0fb0d8d2a6e2969e65ee9a9a74685c#:~:text=Security%20Considerations)). 

Finally, always weigh the legal and ethical implications. Bypassing framing restrictions should be done in good faith, without violating content ownership rights or user safety. In many cases, the **“right” solution is to respect the target site’s policy ([iframe - Overcoming "Display forbidden by X-Frame-Options" - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6666423/overcoming-display-forbidden-by-x-frame-options#:~:text=126))**, but if you have a legitimate need and proceed with caution, a proxy can provide a viable workaround to embed content seamlessly. Use the techniques discussed here responsibly to maintain the balance between functionality and respect for third-party content and security.
